# Udacity-FEND-Build-a-Portfolio-Site
This was my submitted project for the RMIT/Udacity Front End Development Nano Degree. The task was to solidify knowledge in HTML and CSS by creating a single page website. Flex box and breakpoints where used to create responsive content layout for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop).
